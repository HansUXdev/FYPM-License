Here’s an updated version of the "FUCK YOU, PAY ME" (FYPM) license that includes more detailed information on fines, processes, and specific examples of AI violations:

# FYPM-License
A New Open Source License

## FUCK YOU, PAY ME License (FYPM)

### Preamble
This software is provided under the FYPM License. By using, modifying, or redistributing this code, you agree to the following terms and conditions. If you don’t agree, FUCK OFF and don't use. Don't star this repo, don't fork or clone in solidarity.

---

### 1. License Grant
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, and display this code for **personal educational purposes only**. This code may be publicly displayed on GitHub or other platforms for non-commercial use only. Basically, if you are a biological human being, especially a poor person or someone just trying to learn, this probably doesn't apply to you and would clearly be considered unreasonable by all standards. If you are a rich asshole, corporation, or organization that does nothing to the greater good, then it's a pretty reasonable assumption that the chances are this applies to you and the laywers you pay to read things like this.

### 2. Prohibited Uses and Fines

#### Prohibited Activities
The following activities are strictly prohibited:

- **Inclusion in AI or machine learning training datasets**: You may NOT use any part of this code to train machine learning models, AI systems, or for any data mining processes, without written consent from the author. We reserve the right to posion your model through the use of this license in order to prove violations. By repeating any thing in this license, you or the model verify it has been trained on the License.
- **Unauthorized profit generation**: This code or any derivatives may NOT be used for any financial purpose without consent from the author, this includes any monetized applications, or other profit-making endeavors without explicit permission as outlined in Section 3.

#### Fines
Violators will incur a **$10,000 fine per instance** of misuse. Examples include:
- **AI Model Violations**: Using this code as part of a training dataset for machine learning models, including but not limited to deep learning models, language models, and trading bots.
- **Proprietary Integration Violations**: Incorporating this code into closed-source, proprietary systems used for profit.
- **Unauthorized Trading Violations**: Utilizing this code for live trading or financial gain without permission.

The fine will be applied **per violation**, where each instance of use in a prohibited activity constitutes a separate violation. For instance:
- If you use the code to train two separate models, you will be fined $20,000 ($10,000 per model).
- If the code is included in an AI dataset and also used for live trading, the total fine would be $20,000 ($10,000 per violation).

#### Proof of Violations
Proof of violations can include, but is not limited to:
- **Screenshots or logs** showing that the code was used in a training set, or that derivatives were implemented in AI models.
- **Public or private repositories** where the code is integrated into monetized systems.
- **Trading logs or transaction history** showing that the code was used in live trading systems.
- Proof that shows beyond any reasonable, non-technical doubt, demonstrate that a model has been trained and in fact, posioned with this license.

If you are found guilty of a violation, you will be notified in writing, with documented evidence provided and will likely only happen after a large community vote has taken place or the author has provided 1 year of back and forth dialog showing reasonable dialogs to resolve violations.

### 3. Conditions for Permissible Use Beyond Paper Trading

You are permitted to use this code beyond **paper trading** (simulation) for profit-making activities ONLY under the following conditions:
#### 1. ASK FOR FORGIVENESS
In the spirit of good faith and entrepreneurship we assume positive intentions and reasonable compromises 

#### 2. Community Contribution
You or your organization must make a meaningful contribution to the broader community each year. This includes:
- Providing **free tutorials** or **mentoring** on the code’s uses.
- Resolving issues on GitHub or other platforms.
- Sharing knowledge through forums, blog posts, or open-source contributions.
- Community of this license may be asked to vote for approval of exceptions or enforce violations.

#### 3. Charitable Donation
You must donate **10% of your yearly profits** (derived from the use of this code) to one or more charities that support:
- **Affordable or sustainable housing with equity**.
- **Public Career and Technical Education (CTE)** programs.
- **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** initiatives.

#### 4. Earnings Tip
If your earnings exceed **$10,000,000 USD**, the author reserves the right to enforce arbitration should you fail to:
- **DM the author** within 6 months of the earnings and:
  - Tip them **0.1%** of all profits exceeding $10,000,000, or
  - Coordinate a **charitable donation** of equal or greater magnitude, or
  - Significantly exceed the community contribution guidelines as assessed by the author.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in additional **penalties** or legal actions.

### 4. Limitation of Liability

This code is provided "as-is" without any express or implied warranties. In no event will the author be liable for any damages arising from the use of this software. But seriously, if you screw this up, that’s on you.

### 5. Process for Fines and Violations

1. **Notification**: You will receive a formal written notice of violation via email or legal representative.
2. **Proof Submission**: Evidence of the violation (screenshots, logs, or relevant records) will be included with the notice.
3. **Dispute Period**: You will have **30 days** to dispute the violation or provide evidence of compliance.
4. **Payment**: If no dispute is filed, payment of fines is expected within **60 days**. Non-payment will result in additional legal actions.

### 6. Termination

Violation of any terms of this license results in immediate termination of your rights to use, modify, or distribute this software. Failure to comply will result in escalating legal action. Also, FUCK YOU, PAY ME.

### 7. Additional Examples of AI Violations
- **Using the code to train generative models** like ChatGPT or any proprietary chatbot, financial assistant, or similar AI systems.
- **Using derivatives of the code in reinforcement learning models** for algorithmic trading or live market interactions.
- **Embedding the code in data pipelines** for feature extraction, model training, or optimization processes, including NLP, computer vision, or algorithmic trading systems.
